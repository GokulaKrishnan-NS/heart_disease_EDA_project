Project Overview:
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset to identify key factors and relationships associated with heart disease. The focus is on data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and visualization using Python.

Dataset:
The dataset contains 918 records and 12 features, including demographic information, clinical measurements, and the target variable HeartDisease (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease).

Tools and Libraries:
Python 3
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Key Findings (Example):
Chest Pain Type: Asymptomatic chest pain is associated with higher incidence of heart disease.
Age: Heart disease prevalence increases with age, especially after 50.
Exercise Angina: Most patients with heart disease report exercise-induced angina.
